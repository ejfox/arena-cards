This code was originally created as part of a [YouTube video exploring the are.na API and taking control of your own data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly3BXZbWOak)

This uses Nuxt + the are.na API to allow the user to authorize the application, and then see a list of channels. Within a channel, blocks can be dragged anywhere on the page, and they will stay where you left them (because we store the location in local storage)
